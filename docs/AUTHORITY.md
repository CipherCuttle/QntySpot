# Authority — V0C Solana shadow

This document is the binding statement of what the current phase of QntySpot
authorizes and forbids. If any other document in this repository (or any
sibling repository) appears to contradict it, this document wins for the
scope of `qntyspot/`.

```
PROJECT                 = QntySpot
ACTIVE_PHASE            = QNTY_SPOT_V0C_SOLANA_SHADOW
AUTHORITY               = SOLANA_SHADOW_READ_ONLY
NETWORK_AUTHORIZED      = YES (bounded public Solana RPC and Jupiter reads only)
SIGNING_AUTHORIZED      = NO
LIVE_CAPITAL_AUTHORIZED = NO
CAPITAL_AUTHORITY       = NONE
```

These flags are also exported at runtime as `qntyspot.AUTHORITY`,
`qntyspot.NETWORK_AUTHORIZED`, `qntyspot.SIGNING_AUTHORIZED`, and
`qntyspot.LIVE_CAPITAL_AUTHORIZED`.

## V0C authorizes

- Deterministic, immutable domain models (`qntyspot/domain.py`,
  `qntyspot/identity.py`)
- Strict, fail-closed policy parsing (`qntyspot/policy.py`)
- SQLite state transitions with database-enforced invariants
  (`qntyspot/ledger/`)
- Deterministic replay from an empty database plus canonical policies and the
  event log (`qntyspot/ledger/replay.py`)
- Accounting primitives: atomic budget reservation, commit, release, and
  quarantine (`qntyspot/ledger/store.py`)
- Tests, including tests that simulate crash/restart and concurrent workers
- The already-merged bounded Ink shadow implementation remains available as
  historical V0B code; this phase does not change it
- Bounded finalized Solana RPC reads for exactly two policy-supplied mint
  accounts on one frozen cluster
- Current official Jupiter Swap V2 `GET /swap/v2/build` read-only quotes for
  an exact input size and exact mint pair
- Exact mint identity including the Token vs Token-2022 owner program,
  decimals, atomic amounts, route split, program identities, and explicit
  version-0/address-lookup-table semantics
- Deterministic policy-bound shadow decisions with canonical SHA-256 evidence
  and offline replay from frozen live evidence

## V0C forbids

- private-key access
- wallet signing
- transaction construction
- transaction broadcast
- live trading
- venue discovery
- automatic token selection
- bridging
- OpenSea execution
- Robinhood and any other venue adapter

The public-read implementations are limited to `qntyspot/ink.py` and
`qntyspot/solana.py`. The Solana path validates Jupiter's raw instruction
evidence but does not assemble or serialize a transaction, trust any
third-party serialized payload, read a secret, or expose a submission method.
Offline unit tests disable sockets for the entire session; the one live
qualification is a separate, explicitly bounded read-only command.

Enforcement is not aspirational. `tests/test_no_network.py` statically scans
every module under `qntyspot/` for forbidden signing/key/venue-client imports,
subprocess and non-determinism sources, and ambient-secret or signing-related
tokens in source code. `tests/conftest.py` disables the `socket` module for the
entire offline unit-test session. Both checks are part of the required suite.

## Asset selection

Asset selection belongs to the user. Runtime asset admission
(`qntyspot/identity.py`) is concerned with **exact canonical identity and
execution constraints** — chain id and contract address for EVM, cluster,
mint address, and token program for Solana — never with a ticker/symbol
lookup, and never with judging whether a project is good, bad, legitimate, or
likely to rug. `display_symbol` is an optional human label that explicitly
does not participate in identity or in any digest.

KRAKMASK remains the historical user-selected V0B Ink fixture. The V0C
qualification fixture is the exact WSOL/USDC mint pair in
`qualifications/solana_v0c/`; neither fixture is an endorsement, a safety
claim, a recommendation, or an assertion of legitimacy.

## Authority does not flow in from sibling repositories

QntySpot does not inherit live-capital authority from `Qnty`, `QntyLab`, or
`QntyAgentRuntime`. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#authority-boundary-with-sibling-repositories)
for the reconciliation record.

## Chain truth boundary (documented, not implemented)

A future rule, not yet implemented:

- chain/venue truth is authoritative for actual fills
- the local database is authoritative for intended actions
- reconciliation converts external truth into a canonical `FillReceiptV0`
- ambiguity causes `SAFE_HALT`, never speculative reconstruction

`qntyspot/boundary.py` defines the typing `Protocol`s for the chain/venue
boundary. V0B implements the Ink `QuoteSource`; V0C adds the Solana/Jupiter
`QuoteSource`. `ExecutionVenueAdapter`, `ChainTruthSource`, and `Reconciler`
remain unimplemented.

## Changing this document

Any change that would set `NETWORK_AUTHORIZED`, `SIGNING_AUTHORIZED`, or
`LIVE_CAPITAL_AUTHORIZED` to `YES` is a phase transition (see
[docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)), not a routine edit, and requires its own
review.
